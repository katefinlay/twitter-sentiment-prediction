@MaeveHanna Don't call it equality if you're not interested in equality - you're interested in revenge.
@lidzbarfski @glowyshmiff Yeah - it identifies our problems -but it doesn't say how feminism is fixing them. So that's not proof of anything
"@ErenMane It's good - actually I'm about to head to the gym after I finish this report, have a good one brother, peace"
@ErenMane ;3 so cute
"@ErenMane They are also nocturnal unlike most dogs. And they're cute, although many people who like foxes end up getting a shiba inu"
@ErenMane That really is amazing that the fox would spend its energy to care for cubs that will not pass on their own genetics. Unique
"@ErenMane Of course we do - also a shared interest in understanding, sorting through facts, and deciding stances on important issues."
@ErenMane That's awesome - that's been one of my dreams since I was a child. Maybe one day.
@ErenMane That's absolutely ludicrous that anyone could think single parent households are better for children than a nuclear family.
@ErenMane I did not know that - but now I like foxes all the more. Have you seen the silver foxes from Siberia that are tame?
@ErenMane The same thing is beginning to happen to white males too. For the very same reasons.
"@ErenMane Thus engaging in crime, drug abuse, homicide, suicide, which all lead to prison or death. Because they have no place in society"
@ErenMane This solitary aspect alone has caused black men to lose their place in society
@ErenMane See - when a single mother has safety nets (welfare) she does not need a man in order to survive because she has the state.
"@ErenMane Black males experience high unemployment, which leads to crime - which is an aspect of illegitimacy and single motherhood"
@ErenMane is now happening amongst the white community as well
@ErenMane But many researches and myself believe the troubles that began to plague the AA community when feminism began is what
@ErenMane I'm not sure if you're aware of the situation we have in the US - especially among african americans
@ErenMane I'm sorry mate - but that's just the way things are. Only a feminist would argue that a single parent can do a better job than two
"@ErenMane That's good - having a father figure is important I would say. And statistics back it up. It's a crisis, truly."
