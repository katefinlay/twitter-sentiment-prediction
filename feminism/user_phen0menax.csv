@UnCorbeau how? People lost their jobs over it. @lalodagach @Ayaan
"If u're old enuf to go to another country to join a murderous cult that slaughters innocents, u're old enuf to accept abandonment."
@Ali_Jones89 I wouldn't have such a strong opinion on this if I didn't.
@Ali_Jones89 they'll have to Prove that lives weren't lost because of their stupidity.
"@Ali_Jones89 if they haven't killed anyone, we can figure out everything else in stages. But is isn't some one size fits all system."
@Ali_Jones89 please...Your argument has major flaws. I don't agree and I say let them be.
@Ali_Jones89 they will live to regret?? Are you fucking kidding me???  People died!! You are sick
"@Ali_Jones89 this isn't about age anymore. If they've killed people. Fuck em. I don't care what kind of ""victims"" they might be."
"@Ali_Jones89 this 15yr old had the ability to get to the airport,  get on a plane and go to a dangerous country.  .give them some credit."
@Ali_Jones89 And you see them as victims only?? That's just as sick.
"@Ali_Jones89 And I do. I'd rather not have them come back,  seem rehabilitated and then kill more innocents one day. This isn't a joke."
@Ali_Jones89 A kid that's capable of getting hopping onto a plane and going to a whole different country should know better.
@Ali_Jones89 sure you do. And I don't see them as victims. I see them as willing participants.
@Ali_Jones89 it's not laziness. How is it laziness?? We didn't send them there? All of a sudden it's our responsibility?
@Ali_Jones89 if they've killed people I don't care if they went at 7. We're talking about lives well never get back.
@Ali_Jones89 well in that case I hope they don't bother coming back.
"@Ali_Jones89 if they've murdered people, yes. Leave them be. It was their choice. If they change it,  they can immigrate with due process."
