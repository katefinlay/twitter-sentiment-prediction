"@Jivan_san Definitely not a victim, just aware of social issues. Now kindly fuck off into the sunset and go bother someone else."
@Jivan_san You have a sincere misunderstanding of the global status of women's rights and representation.
@Jivan_san LOL! I think you honestly believe that that is their only reason for making that movie. And it makes me feel sorry for you.
@Jivan_san Again you've missed the point. It's not about quality. It's the fact that an all male one needed to be made in the first place.
@Jivan_san Then go watch the originals with their all male casts intact and keep your misogynistic bellyaching off my twitter.
@Jivan_san This all male reboot is for butthurt MRA's who think that because the main cast has vaginas they're not allowed to see the movie.
"@Jivan_san Yes I am a feminist because I believe in real equality for all genders. The all male reboot is not equality, don't pretend it is."
@Jivan_san That you use feminist as an insult tells me everything I ever need to know about you. Feminism isn't about man hating.
@Jivan_san Then you've missed the point entirely. Gonna take a wild guess and say you have unironically uttered the phrase 'not all men'.
@Jivan_san @rusted_brandy @Sony Because without the all-male reboot men would have zero representation in current media. #thatsnotequality
19 days and I'm still not over @Sony announcing the misogynistic horse shit that is the all male #Ghostbusters reboot.

@Sony is making an all male #Ghostbusters too because there simply aren't enough movies out there with strong male leads. #areyoukiddingme
The ending of this season of #AgentCarter broke my heart in the best way. @HayleyAtwell is a phenomenal actress and deserves all the awards.
