"@Pandafringe Now, why should *I* take what you have to say seriously, if you need to behave like a child?

"@Pandafringe That's rich. Because when I did answer your questions, as well as the majority of you feminists, you resort to ad hominem."
"You know what's bullshit? The claim that 1 in 5 women in the world are raped.

@Pandafringe Way to avoid the question. Typical feminist.
@Pandafringe Would you object to it though?
@DanielleCheney Do you usually toss petty insults and mock others when you are losing a debate?
"@DanielleCheney So you resort to ad hominems and petty insults like a child, because you don't like the fact that I challenged your words."
"@DanielleCheney Based on a survey, at an American college? Which, isn't a national, or a worldwide statistic mind you..."
"@DanielleCheney Now, maybe if you really care so much about ""equal pay"" maybe you should campaign that you women work twice as hard at a job"
"@DanielleCheney So you're saying that 1 out of every 5 women in the world are raped?  Based on... What, hmm?"
@DanielleCheney Putting more effort into a job tends to yield a raise and a higher payout. Just saying. ;)
"@DanielleCheney The reason why us men get paid more, is because mostly, we are willing to work harder, and put more effort into a job."
"@DanielleCheney If you want equal pay, then maybe you should do what us guys do and put 110%+ effort and work in our jobs."
"Apparently 1 in 4 women are raped. And you're basing that on, what, exactly?
87.6% of statistics are made up on the spot.

"In other news, the 1 in 5 rape statistic has now went from 1 in 5, to 1 in 4. Anyone else calling bullshit?

"@Pandafringe So, you're saying that women do not sexualize men  if they have abs, a beard, or tattoos?"
"@DanielleCheney Yeah, and the mainstream media loves to enforce the idea that all men must have abs in order to be attractive. Your point?"
"@DanielleCheney ""How do we stand a chance of being respected?"" If you care about someone's respect, then earn it."
"@DanielleCheney http://t.co/g5tvgtzeUh

I should also add that not every woman goes to college. So that statistic is a load of wank. :D"
"@DanielleCheney 1 in 4? Sounds like bullshit. Then again, you clowns did claim that it was 1 in 5 back in Winter."
