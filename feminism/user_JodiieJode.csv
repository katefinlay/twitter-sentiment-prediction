@CharleyPC nothing worse!
I hate it when people say they're going to do something if they don't mean it.. I'd rather they just didn't say it.

@beckygitsham_ haha exactly!! Kip Moore's face and FGL showed the others how it's done! lady A were amazing though
"@beckygitsham_ he was good but I was kind of let down, maybe I built it up too much because he was my favourite from the line up! ðŸ™ˆ"

@beckygitsham_ they were amazing they totally blew Luke Bryan out of the water who kind of sucked majorly ðŸ™ˆ &amp; he was the reason I went!
@beckygitsham_ they were like two hillbilly frat boys it was amazing
"@beckygitsham_ I went to c2c for Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean and Lady A but I've got to say my faves were FGL&amp; and Kip Moore! (&amp; Lady A)"
@beckygitsham_ oh man!! Haha thanks for getting back to me! Hopefully they come over again!
@beckygitsham_ had heard their music before but C2C just blew me away would love the see them again xx
"@beckygitsham_ hi ðŸ˜¬ thought you were the best person to ask this, do FGL do any UK shows for their Anything Goes tour or anything else?"
