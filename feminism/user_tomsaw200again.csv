"@RedEagleAn0n Also. Look up ""cognitive dissonance"". Feminists are experiencing it here"
@RedEagleAn0n I suppose no feminist should ever be able to present facts because they have opinions. Great logic there
"@RedEagleAn0n If you want to see the actual facts of this catfishing hoax (which is what it is), look here: http://t.co/12FZXhKHy0"
@RedEagleAn0n This isn't soap opera. This is a girl who made up a story about being gang raped in rolling stone to get her crush to like her
@RedEagleAn0n We know the guy who Jackie claimed led the gang rape doesn't even exist. It takes a delusional person to deny that she lied.
@RedEagleAn0n  She told her friends that Haven Monahan led the gang rape against her. Turns out Haven Monahan was part of her imagination.
"@RedEagleAn0n Jackie told her friends that ""Drew"" (a pseudonym for Haven Monahan) led the gang rape after a date she claimed they went on."
"@RedEagleAn0n @MayneSammy If you claimed Darth Vader raped you on a date and it turned out he didn't even exist, it's certainly suspicious"
@RedEagleAn0n @MayneSammy Your point being what?
"@88shenanigans I lock my car too. I'm actually a male. So, this isn't a gender specific problem."
@radMaryMargaret Nope.
"@RedEagleAn0n @MayneSammy Look up ""Haven Monahan"" and tell me Jackie didn't lie."
"@heyitsAymen In the modern west, if there is a gender that has privilege, it is women."
"@heyitsAymen Women vote. It is both gender selecting these people. And, the fact that somebody is a man doens't mean they care about all men"
"@heyitsAymen The fact that women are doing better than men on virtually every social indicator. Also, the legal system favors women over men"
@heyitsAymen That does not control for hours worked and amount of danger. Men are 92% of occupational deaths in the USA and work more hours.
It takes a very delusional person to believe that males are privileged over women in modern America. #feminism #yesallwomen #feminismisawful
#Feminism is built on myths and lies. Nothing more. Nothing less. It is both sad and pathetic that the movement has come to this awfulness
"@strangeBUTcute8 If you look at what feminists actually advocate, it just female privilege and myths"
@heyitsAymen Open yours. I just responded to all of your previous tweets with definitive debunking. Western women are simply not oppressed
