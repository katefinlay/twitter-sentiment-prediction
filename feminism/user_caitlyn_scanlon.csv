I'm so lonely and have no one to blame but myself.
Maybe I'm just bitter because I didn't really discover my true self until recently.
What fifteen year old knows their self well enough to live every living moment trying to impress someone?
Girls that fall so blindly in love so young make me so sad.
I've been so sick the last week so when my mom came home with this I actually cried. I miss you so much. &lt;3 http://t.co/WeBFIM98LC

Moral of the story: I am very sick and not 100% of my brain is awake
I tweeted about the nutrigrain bars and now twitters run by middle aged guys with nice head shots keep retweeting me.
I had a gay best friend before the allure of having a gay best friend was even a thing.
impossible to get headaches from nutrigrain bars but it's still true today 13 years later so idk I'm just sayin (2/2)
One time My mom packed me a nutrigrain bar for snack in Kdg and I remember crying bc they gave me headaches and my teacher told me its (1/2)
@brittanyfust I had a fever and a headache for six days. Now I just have a headache and an ear infection and now hallucinations of Jesus
Is it barley or barely
My sleep schedule doesn't make sense because I sleep when my brain doesn't hurt which is barely ever.
Also nasal spray isn't the worst.
I don't think I'm going to be able to drive to detroit tomorrow considering I can't see.
Day seven. Still sick. Having hallucinations of Jesus. Is this heaven.
"But in all seriousness, I took two ibuprofen earlier and I have had zero pain relief."
"The pressure in my head is pressing up against my eyes which makes me think I'm really tired, so I try to sleep but can't because I'm not."
