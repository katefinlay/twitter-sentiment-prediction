"Cole world, real cold world"
Me at NVC every morning  https://t.co/os6hRslTqE
ONLY reason I kept my composure was because I really like my professor and I didn't want to make him uncomfortable.
We were talking about the shooting of Walter Scott and some white girl called it propaganda. Literally. I almost yelled.
I'm so mad I can't even rant about this on here.
Literally so done with most of the white people at NVC. I'm about to yell.
