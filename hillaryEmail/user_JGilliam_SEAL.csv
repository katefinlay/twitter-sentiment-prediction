@gadzooks114 absolutely.
@gadzooks114 those are cults not Christians.
"@gadzooks114 none of the examples were meant to be an insult, just recognizable traits so people can see how important self policing is."
@gadzooks114 very few Christian denominations closed as the fundamental nature of Christianity is to invite as many people in as possible
"@gadzooks114 not only is your point overly aggressive, it's ridiculous. Orthodox and Hasidic communities are closed societies."
@gadzooks114 I used them both as examples of closed / reserved cultures.  It's important to pick examples that everyone can identify with.
@gadzooks114 Closed societies have to police themselves because no one understands what is normal better than those that live inside.
@gadzooks114 practices?  Not sure what your question is.
In the green room above the @CNN machine! http://t.co/P2Uy3ncrye
