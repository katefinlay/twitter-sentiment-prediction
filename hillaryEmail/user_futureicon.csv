@CarlyFiorina as the @GOP nominee with @RealBenCarson as her running-mate.  Certainly a remote possibility; but anything can happen.
@backatone000 @topwater235 @SenTedCruz  Will conservatives; such as @GrahamBlog @JebBush once again weaken the @GOP chances as did McCain?
"@mooretommyh @BarackObama  You may well be right, Tommy.  Many await a fabricated crisis as he has no intention of leaving the White House."
Someone needs to neutralize @BarackObama before he totally achieves his plan of destroying America.
"@RandPaul /Will you publicly call out Holder @TheJusticeDept for protecting Lerner, Clinton, Bergdahl, Obama and others?"
@PatVPeters / I believe someone will have to physically neutralize @BarackObama before he totally achieves his plan of destroys America.
@PhxKen @gcsb77 @marklevin / Let me simplify this..  I trust @BarackObama with protecting US from Iran as far as I can toss his prayer rug.
"@thehill @Norsu2 / Despite legislation to stop Iranian nuclear agreement, @BarackObama will unilaterally put it in place via an Exec./Order."
"ON IRAN; MR. OBAMA:
- Who gets the uranium?
- How are sanctions lifted?
- What about their ICBMs?
- Do they continue R&amp;D with centrifuges?"
@statesperson @chris63414391 / Roscoe Coltraine seemed to always be outsmarted by those Duke boys.
@AdCatolic @1catherinesiena / Persecution and growth are on opposite sides of the coin.  The persecution of Christians bring more followers.
"RT @AdCatolic: ""This is no time to be ashamed of the Gospel. It is the time to preach it from the rooftops."" -St Pope John Paul ll #Catholiâ€¦"
"@greta  Your Wisconsin Badgers shouldn't be ashamed or apologize for their participation in last night's final game.
IT WAS A GREAT CONTEST"
@JessicaChasmar @Doc_JJK / Wonderful.  Those are the kind of stories one loves to hear about.
"Much like the days of prohibition and Al Capone, @JerryBrownGov says he may arrest anyone sneaking in illegal water from outside California."
"Insiders say @BarackObama still undecided as to where he wants to locate his Presidential Library.
- Mombasa
- Havana
- Tehran 
- Chicago"
Rather ironic that the @ENERGY Department was affected by a widespread power outage in the Washington DC area?
BREAKING:  We've just received confirmation from Edward Snowden that the widespread power outages in DC are due to @FLOTUS shaving her legs.
"Don't know yet for whom I'll vote for; but it won't be a Democrat.  I'd sooner see Satan sitting in our White House.
OMIGOSH HE'S THERE NOW!"
