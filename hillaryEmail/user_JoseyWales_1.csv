"@PeterLegend @NickDobo Hell 2 yrs ago I was ready 2 trade everyone!  Give me a healthy defense/offense &amp; run as the underdog,
Less pressure"
"@PeterLegend @NickDobo my biggest complaint about fleury is ... not controlling the puck, preventing those rebounds."
@PeterLegend @NickDobo That stat looks bad but defense is lacking mid game &amp; on. Not to mention bad bounces like tonight's puck of skate
"Russia hacks the White House....hmm I wonder if same #Obama lackeys developed #Obamacare security, &amp; I'm sure #HillaryEmail is secure. Baha!"
@PeterLegend @NickDobo Yep. Our defense is a revolving door right now. Fleury's having a great season. League leading 9 shut-outs
"@KDPomp The #Pens should have been a dynasty team. Instead we have constant discipline, power-play, trade, &amp; coaching issues when it matters"
@PeterLegend Not blaming the our high value guys. Crosby &amp; Malkin have over 12 goals a piece where 6 or 8 other guys only have 12 combined
@KDPomp #Pens ran out of gas in 2nd period. #Fleury &amp; #Crosby can't carry this team. Most of these guys don't deserve 3rd line status

I love it when #Crosby oozes talent. #GoPens
#BOOM #Pens seem to be in control of their destiny!
@piaSavage The lack of respect &amp; understanding is sad. The person that took the video is a hero. The law is the law regardless of race.
