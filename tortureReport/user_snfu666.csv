A beautiful destruction? #stoptheswap #lavnothinglefttolose http://t.co/endHILgfj9
Laverendrye needs solutions. A wholesale swap with Earl Grey ain't it! #stoptheswap #lavnothinglefttolose
I support sharing of resources. I don't support a complete swap that dismantles Earl Grey. #stoptheswap #lavnothinglefttolose #winnipeg
Destroying a school is NOT sharing. #stoptheswap #lavnothinglefttolose http://t.co/xRQK3LtTri
"Wanting to destroy a school, hurting vulnerable kids seems like bullying. #stoptheswap #lavnothinglefttolose"
Defending what we have in the face of condescending and hurtful folks is not bullying. #stoptheswap #lavnothinglefttolose
We should share resources. Dismantling Earl Grey is not an act of sharing. #stoptheswap #lavnothinglefttolose
Adding a French track to Earl Grey would be sharing. A full swap is not sharing. #stoptheswap #lavnothinglefttolose
Sharing is beautiful and wonderful. Dismantling a school is not sharing. #stoptheswap #lavnothinglefttolose
