@OnPointRadio @SteveDeaceShow GOP in national elections is not feasible. Come on people. 2016 could be a 60+% for democrats. GOP must change
"@OnPointRadio @ktumulty @dhwinston @SteveDeaceShow Mr Deace's Bush take was potent. Feels right. But, Paul, Rubio, Cruz? Less than 0 chance."
@EducationFreedo @SteveDeaceShow I think you are right.  Great point!
@jimbearNJ @SteveDeaceShow that's a very good point BearNJ.
"@OnPointRadio @SteveDeaceShow Bush will get the nomination. Watch. And, he will lose. It's a problem with GOP brand. Paul, Rubio, no chance"
@SteveDeaceShow I think your listeners only watch Fox News.  Not surprising.
@Slate why do this? There was no explanation. I'll just take the easy road. Like everyone else.

"Re Iran deal, &amp; Obama: ""Chamberlain,"" ""Chamberlain,"" is yelled. People, mass communication didn't exist then. It's DIFFERENT now! #IranDeal"
"@withrowzone @MattTaliaferro Chad, you know being in the radio you'll attract the weirdos. KY fan is still pretty butthurt too."
"@tomashbrooknpr Tom Ashbrook, he IS the Kwisatz Haderach! (Missed Ya for the big Iran talk today) http://t.co/7Ed0I8zHVd"
"@YahooSports @DanWetzel I disagree, and I'm no KY fan. HUGE pressure on a kid and he snapped. How many 50 yr olds snap daily. #forgiven."
@DrewRoc5 Not a Kentucky fan. But you should be forgiven. Those games are huge pressure on young people. How many 50 yr olds snap daily?
@dailykos How easily jackasses like Tom Cotton are willing to toss away american lives for their political overlords and personal benefit.
The elephant in the room is Israel's illegal secret nukes.  @Guardian article. http://t.co/D21JeGIsgu LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS!
@OnPointRadio I really hope Israel's secret illegal nuclear weapons come up in tomorrow's discussion. I think it's the elephant in the room
No fan base disappears faster than Kentucky fan after a loss. The loudness turns into crickets. Even faster than a losing Alabama FB fan.
