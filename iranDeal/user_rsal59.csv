@BlackBerry how should we order it?!!
#BlackBerryClassic I own an old 9320.Does classic support arabic letters to be used say in viber? If so how a physical keyboard can do that?
Blackberry should have never removed the belt from Q10. Can Blackberry Classic undo this mistake? Isn't it late? We should wait and see.
BlackBerry Classic Preview and Full specs http://t.co/URDmULFb1p via @KporalDsm
@Amirhossei9 boro baba delet khosheh
@BlackBerry no specs released then asking people to order. Are you serious?
@Courtre @BlackBerry I agree. Whenever I go to bb website with my curve 9320 the browser crashes!!
@UKBlackberry pre-ordering something that its specs has not been formally released? I don't think so.
@Ronell_j wow! Really cool app!
@BB_in I signed up and did not receive anything so far even a confirmation email!!!
@jennyhelmann blackberry is not for kids to play with. It is not a toy.
@bbcommunity December not Desember
@jt_teran let's put it this way: BlackBerry is not for kids to play with.
@Track_BB_News no it cannot bend because you cannot put it inside your pants' pocket...
@Bla1ze when will it come to the market?
