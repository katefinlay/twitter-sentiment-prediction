@bbclysedoucet @BowenBBC @jonsnowC4 Such hypocrisy: @PSCupdates no mention #YarmoukCamp. But if it was #gaza... http://t.co/Tks8hlvLls
"@charIesfrith @bbclysedoucet @bbcworldservice yet still say didn't see #hamas.Also v quiet on 
#amnesty condemnation of hamas war crimes 2/2"
@charIesfrith @bbclysedoucet @bbcworldservice absolutely but they never admit it. Just say easier to get in! 1/2
@bbclysedoucet @bbcworldservice back to same old. Why access in #Gaza so easy? #hamas give you free pass &amp; you report their story.
@bbclysedoucet @BowenBBC talk is of a summer #Lebanon war. Remember this post when you report http://t.co/OstCPYWDx2 http://t.co/yVG8gZUuTe
"@bbclysedoucet @bbcworldservice Lyse, article I posted earlier sums it up well http://t.co/i6ACZ0zg3D put your critical appraisal into gear"
"@bbclysedoucet @bbcworldservice just stand back and compare frequency, depth and tone of coverage of #Yarmouk vs #Gaza. Massive difference"
@zlando @gershonbaskin yet another unholy alliance.  How #assad must be rubbing his hands in glee.
"@MiddleEastEye witness the lack of response to #palestinian slaughter in #Yarmouk - no #UN condemnation, no weeping journos. #nojewsnonews"
"@MiddleEastEye pre 67 #jordan occupied #westbank &amp; #egypt occupied #gaza &amp; there was no #palestine, no #BDS, no @PSCupdates. #nojewsnonews"
@MiddleEastEye witness #gaza - could have been Singapore of Mid East but chose #hamas &amp; perpetual violence
"@MiddleEastEye the blind spot is that #palestinians have never chosen peace, perpetuate victimhood  &amp; given opportunity throw it away 2/2"
@MiddleEastEye what evidence return to 67 borders will bring peace? There were 3 wars til 67 &amp; no peace. Giving up #gaza brought #hamas. 1/2
@MiddleEastEye #gaza not occupied.
Front page @BBCWorld not a word on #Yarmouk.Clearly nothing to do with caring about #Palestinians but #nojewsnonews @bbclysedoucet @BowenBBC
"@bbclysedoucet @BowenBBC @jonsnowC4 &amp; you'll fail to notice your indifference to #Yarmouk, to #Mosul etc as you're back bashing #Israel 2/2"
"http://t.co/OstCPZeeVC &amp; see how quickly #un condemn #israel, @bbclysedoucet @BowenBBC @jonsnowC4 will weep on air, &amp; marches will occur 1/2"
Odd - both #Hezbollah &amp; @jstreetdotorg think the #IranDeal good. When Hezbollah wage war on #Israel in summer will Jstreet still cheer?
@BBCWorld @bbclysedoucet @BowenBBC @jonsnowC4 @Dannythefink @montie @LondonBDS @PSCupdates MUST read: http://t.co/i6ACZ0zg3D @JewishNewsUK
Odd isn't it? #nojewsnonews @BBCWorld @bbclysedoucet @BowenBBC @jonsnowC4 @MelanieLatest @UNWatch http://t.co/973aMKen62
